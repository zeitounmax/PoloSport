## Concept

For my end-of-study project, I came up with the idea of a sports-based youtube.
The use of React,Node,Express but also Argon2, JsonWebToken are the bases of my project.
The videos are stored in a database and it's possible to add videos via an in-house CMS.

## How to use it?

For the use of the project

- Clone the project
- Get the nodes modules with `npm install` .
- Start the server and client with `npm run dev`
